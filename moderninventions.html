                    <p>Google is at the forefront of innovation in Machine Intelligence, with active research exploring virtually all aspects of machine learning, including deep learning and more classical algorithms. Google brain was created in 2012. This was a deep neural network created by Jeff Dean of Google, which focused on pattern detection in images and videos. It was able to use Google’s resources, which made it incomparable to much smaller neural networks. It was later used to detect objects in YouTube videos.</p>

                    <p>Alexnet is a convolutional neural network (CNN) developed in 2012.  AlexNet won the ImageNet competition by a large margin in 2012, which led to the use of GPUs in machine learning. They also created ReLU, which is an activation function that greatly improves efficiency of CNNs.</p>

                    <p>DeepFace is a deep learning facial recognition system created by a research group at Facebook. It identifies human faces in digital images. It employs a nine-layer neural network with over 120 million connection weights and was trained on four million images uploaded by Facebook users.  DeepFace shows human-level performance. The Facebook Research team has stated that the DeepFace method reaches an accuracy of 97.35% ± 0.25% on Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW) data set where human beings have 97.53%. This means that DeepFace is sometimes more successful than the human beings.</p>

                    <p>This company was bought by Google, and can play basic video games to the same levels as humans. In 2016, it managed to beat a professional at the game Go, which is considered to be one the world’s most difficult board games. Today their programs have learned to diagnose eye diseases as effectively as the world’s top doctors, to save 30% of the energy used to keep data centres cool, and to predict the сomplex 3D shapes of proteins - which could one day transform how drugs are invented.</p>

OpenAI’s mission is to ensure that artificial general intelligence (AGI)—by which we mean highly autonomous systems that outperform humans at most economically valuable work—benefits all of humanity.</p>

                    <p>Nvidia is used by Amazon to power their Amazon Web Service Machine Learning platform. This is because they are creating GPUs specifically for machine learning, for example the Tesla V100, announced in May 2017. This used Tensor Cores, which are used for matrix arithmetic in machine learning. A tensor core can compute 64 fixed point operations per clock cycle, as it provides a 4x4x4 matrix processing array. This means lots of operations can be processed in a single clock cycle, which is much more efficient than a CPU, and even more than an unoptimised GPU.</p>
                    <p>The NVIDIA V100 Tensor Core GPU delivers unprecedented acceleration at every scale for AI, data analytics, and HPC to tackle the world’s toughest computing challenges. As the engine of the NVIDIA data center platform, V100 can efficiently scale up to thousands of GPUs or, using new Multi-Instance GPU (MIG) technology, can be partitioned into seven isolated GPU instances to accelerate workloads of all sizes.</p>
