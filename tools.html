                <p>MNIST (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology database) is a Arabic <b>numeral handwriting database</b>. There are over 60,000 handwriting samples of each digit in the database.</p>
                <p>The <b>data consists of pre-prepared sample images</b>, on the basis of which the systems are trained and tested. The database was created after revising the original 20x20 pixel set of NIST black and white samples.</p>
                <p>There have been numerous attempts to achieve minimal error after training on the MNIST database, which have been discussed in the scientific literature. Record results were indicated in publications devoted to the use of convolutional neural networks, the error rate was brought to 0.23%. The creators of the database themselves have provided several testing methods. The original work indicates that the use of support vector machines achieves an error rate of 0.8%.</p>
                <p>Some works note the high results of systems built on ensembles of several neural networks; at the same time, the quality of digit recognition for the MNIST base turns out to be comparable to that of a person, and for other recognition tasks, in particular, for road signs, it is even twice as good.</p>

                <img class="left" src="images/teach.gif" alt="">
                <p>This neural network tries to recognize a handwritten digit. To train it, you will need to enter several samples of Arabic digits. To create it, you need a handwriting field. We used "canvas" as such a field. Buttons are also needed in order to record sample numbers and train the neural network. The image on the canvas is broken down into a grid of pixels. The pixelated image is saved as a vector of ones and zeros. Each such vector is written into a list, which is sent to the "brain.js" library for training the neural network. In order for the already trained neural network to analyze the input data, the "likely ()" function is called.
