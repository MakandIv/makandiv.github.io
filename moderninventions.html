                <img class="left" src="images/googlebrain.png" alt="">
                <p>Google is at the forefront of innovation in Machine Intelligence, with <b>active research exploring</b> virtually all aspects of machine learning, including deep learning and more classical algorithms. Google brain was created in 2012. This was a deep neural network created by Jeff Dean of Google, which focused on pattern detection in images and videos. It was able to use Google’s resources, which made it incomparable to much smaller neural networks.</p>
                <p><b>Google Brain's mission</b> is to improve people's lives by building smarter machines. To do this, the team focuses on creating flexible models that are able to independently obtain features, as well as efficiently use data and computing power.</p>
                <p><b>Recent achievements:</b></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>An encryption system developed by artificial intelligence.</li>
                    <li>Increasing image resolution.</li>
                    <li>Advanced word translation.</li>
                    <li>Speech recognition system.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2><span class="text_border">AlexNet</span></h2>
                <img class="left" src="images/AlexNet-1-1.png" alt="">
                <p>AlexNet is a convolutional neural network (CNN) developed in 2012. AlexNet won the ImageNet competition by a large margin in 2012, which led to the use of GPUs in machine learning. They also <b>created ReLU</b>, which is an activation function that greatly improves efficiency of CNNs.</p>
                <p>AlexNet <b>contained eight layers</b>; the first five were convolutional layers, some of them followed by max-pooling layers, and the last three were fully connected layers. It used the non-saturating ReLU activation function, which showed improved training performance over other.</p>

                <img class="right" src="images/deepface.jpg" alt="">
                <p>DeepFace is a deep learning <b>facial recognition system</b> created by a research group at Facebook. It identifies human faces in digital images. It employs a nine-layer neural network with over 120 million connection weights and was trained on four million images uploaded by Facebook users. DeepFace shows human-level performance. The Facebook Research team has stated that the DeepFace method reaches an accuracy of 97.35% ± 0.25% on Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW) data set where human beings have 97.53%. This means that DeepFace is sometimes more successful than the human beings.</p>
                <p>The technology looks really amazing, especially against the background of not very successful attempts to create mechanisms for direct identification of people. Despite the early stage of development, the proposed system is able to significantly reduce the overall error in methods of face recognition and ratio.</p>

                <p>This company was bought by Google, and can play basic video games to the same levels as humans. In 2016, it managed <b>to beat a professional at the game Go</b>, which is considered to be one the world’s most difficult board games. Today their programs have learned to diagnose eye diseases as effectively as the world’s top doctors, to save 30% of the energy used to keep data centers cool, and to predict the complex 3D shapes of proteins - which could one day transform how drugs are invented.</p>
                <p><b>The company's goal</b> is "to solve the problem of intelligence." To do this, they use "the best technologies, ranging from machine learning to systems psychophysiology, to ultimately create general-purpose learning algorithms." They are also working on formalizing intelligence in order not only to implement it in machines, but also to understand how the human brain works.</p>

                <p>This is a non-profit organization created in 2015 by Elon Musk and others, to create safe artificial intelligence. <b>OpenAI’s mission</b> is to ensure that artificial general intelligence (AGI)—by which we mean highly autonomous systems that outperform humans at most economically valuable work — <b>benefits all of humanity</b>.</p>
                <p>On April 27, 2016, the company released a public beta of <b>OpenAI Gym</b>, a platform for developing and comparing reinforcement learning algorithms.</p>
                <p>Reinforcement learning is one of the artificial intelligence algorithms that has recently shown good results in various complex fields: robotics, board games (AlphaGo), video games (DeepMind results). OpenAI Gym aims to provide a toolkit to assist in research in this area. The platform provides researchers with an easy-to-install framework with a collection of diverse learning test environments.</p>
                <p>OpenAI Gym is implemented in the <b>Python</b> programming language, supports machine learning libraries <b>TensorFlow</b>, <b>Theano</b>.</p>

                <p>This is part of Amazon Web Services, and shows how most big companies want to get involved in machine learning. They say it drives many of their internal systems, from regularly used services such as search recommendations and Alexa, to more experimental ones like Prime Air and Amazon Go.</p>
                <p>Amazon has created an IDE (Integrated Development Environment) that works with machine learning. Amazon <b>SageMaker</b> helps data scientists and developers to prepare, build, train, and deploy high-quality machine learning (ML) models quickly by bringing together a broad set of capabilities purpose-built for ML. Amazon SageMaker is built on Amazon’s two decades of experience developing real-world machine learning applications, including product recommendations, personalization, intelligent shopping, robotics, and voice-assisted devices.</p>

                    <p>Nvidia is used by Amazon to power their Amazon Web Service Machine Learning platform. This is because they are creating GPUs specifically for machine learning, for example the Tesla V100, announced in May 2017. This used Tensor Cores, which are used for matrix arithmetic in machine learning. A tensor core can compute 64 fixed point operations per clock cycle, as it provides a 4x4x4 matrix processing array. This means lots of operations can be processed in a single clock cycle, which is much more efficient than a CPU, and even more than an unoptimised GPU.</p>
                    <p>The NVIDIA V100 Tensor Core GPU delivers unprecedented acceleration at every scale for AI, data analytics, and HPC to tackle the world’s toughest computing challenges. As the engine of the NVIDIA data center platform, V100 can efficiently scale up to thousands of GPUs or, using new Multi-Instance GPU (MIG) technology, can be partitioned into seven isolated GPU instances to accelerate workloads of all sizes.</p>
